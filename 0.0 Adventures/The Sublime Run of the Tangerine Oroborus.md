## 0.0 Intro
A volcanic dust envelopes the city of [[Thule]], its fine black soot floats through the streets like a fog, settling on surfaces like an anti-frost. The city looms on its unending voyage through the volcanic cloud, blind, unaware of its bearing. Fitting weather for turbulent times.
It is the day of the bi-election for [[Rhetoric District 22]]. Council member [[Sladega A'Falious]] had mysteriously disappeared weeks ago, leading up to a critical vote. The ultimate particle accelerator in Thule has completed construction, it is poised to commence collision. With [[Sladega A'Falious]] pronounced a missing person, and the vote split 50-50, this bi-election has decided the fate of many.
This accelerator, an industrial halo, is Thule's final attempt at quantum theory and particle physics. It cuts through the city like an unstoppable force, a colossal alter to sacrifice the ancient [[Proto-Gods]] and to enter the era of the future [[Magescience]] [[Ultima-God]]. Many refugees from advanced technological backgrounds refer to it as a particle accelerator, but magescientists pedantically correct them, clouting it as the "[[Limina Expanse Amplifier mk.III]]". It has taken a significant amount of time and money to build, despite mountains of political hurdles, financial crisis and zoning scandals. But the super cooled tube runs the circumference of Thule, mounted off the roofs of housing estates, viaducts and cantilevered off the pit wall, completed.

During construction, opinions shifted. With the oligarchs and the high council of Thule undecided, a final vote would decide if the endeavor will execute. The public were split, fueled by polarised [[Social Panic]].

Many Thule citizens were concerned with the results of previous smaller particle accelerator experiments. Although the technologies produced from the findings were beneficial and profitable, there were several small localised cataclysms on the way. Despite rigorous safety protocols put in place, the concern that a large particle accelerator would result in a large universal cataclysm, has amplified to become; mass irrational fear.

Parallel to this, many proletariat citizens and refugees are positioned to make significant financial returns from this venture. Many factors, including Thule's overpopulation/housing crisis and economic recession has meant that the accelerator has had to be built above ground, suspended off some of the poorest Thulese housing and infrastructure. The project could not afford to buy all those properties, and instead shares in the accelerators profits were promised instead, enough to cover a whole families ongoing average income per person. Money for these people is more than just food on the table. Because of overpopulation, insignificant crimes are being met with severe punishments, and finances are needed to help grease the judicial system. A significant portion of the Thulese lower class now own the dormant accelerator. The panic of the anti-accelerator movement had negative effects on the lower class; they would lose everything they were promised. To them, people weren't concerned about a cataclysm, they were the panicked bourgeoisie, trying to prevent a possible class coup fueled by [[Magescience]].

_"To create fear, hold up a mirror"_

The Oligarchs of Rhetoric District had voted, and the new council member is Dr Formagia Cudge, a professor at the Thule Institute of Technology, a pro-accelerator. With the final vote counted, officially the accelerator could start.
Meanwhile the political factions of Thule, and their fanatic followers clash. One side is rioting to stop the research. They'll destroy everything to prevent it. Conversely, the pro-accelerators are counter-rioting, an illegal militia of vigilantes attempting to protect their investment at all costs.
Mixed in with all the chaos are the Council funded Public Relation officers, a Riot Squad. The [[PR Goons]] are profiteering off any rioter or unruly vanguard they can apprehend, every baton strike is an extra commission and convictions result in bonuses. They are unbiased in their violence.

You find yourself urged into the fray, the rioters breaking through the gates of the accelerator control campus. A current of people flowing like a river to clash with their opponents.

_Are you trying to save the world?
Are you trying to save your livelihood, your investment?
Are you trying to snag a catch, bonk some baddies and make some creds?
Are you trying to save your hard earned research?_

The resulting melee is like a psychedelic apocalypse. Magic and technology explode around you as if a demented fire works display was turned on its audience. Buffeted like a plastic bag in the wind, by mobs of people, explosions, water cannons and summoned atrocities, you are lucky to be alive at the end of it all... or are you?

## 0.1 Interogation
Your not sure if you woke up, or just fazed into existence, the overwhelming hum of industrial white noise droning through your skull is proof you are alive. You find yourself in a wide and deep cylindrical room, lined with rough concrete panels, with no ceiling; exposed to the sky, there doesn't seem to be any floor other than a catwalk that connects your position to an ominous door. Cables suspend the catwalk from the inner walls, some supporting loose air ducts and coloured electrical wires, capacitors mark locations where the cables intersect. The air is hot and muggy, like a sauna, and volcanic ash motes meander on the thermal currents, hovering in and out of your focus. Occasionally they cause plasma sparks as they collide with the capacitors above. You are sitting on a hard concrete block, at a hard concrete table, handcuffed and chained to a rusty loop protruding from the center. The heat of the metal on your writsts is almost unbearable. Glowing multicolour barcodes from the PR Goon's batons are stamped over your bruised swollen arms.

The droning noise makes it difficult to notice the door opening, two blurry figures come into focus as they march across the catwalk.
The slender androgynous one sits down in front of you, sweat already beading on her? forehead.
The other, a heavy set male, dressed in the sickly mauve jumpsuit of the PR Goons stands in the background, his attention on the interregator, not on you. His hand rests attentively on his [[Big Batonâ„¢]].

>"Good Evening [honourific name], I am [[Yvonne Wryly |Corporal Wryly]] from the Ministry of Truth, I have been assigned your case worker for the following hour, in respect for the time and sancitity of process, we request you remain silent unless asked a direct question."

Even with them speaking, you can't pick their gender. They want you to keep quiet, you try to speak, but you are exhausted, best to comply for now to get back your strength.
>"We have collected evidence which points to your involvement in several crimes over the last few weeks, possibly months, and as a major actor in the riots last night in Rhetoric District 16.
We regret to inform you that because you missed your trial and sentencing this morning, you have waived all rights to legal representation. [[Duncan Clench|Corporal Clench]] here ..."

they gesture sharply to the thug...
>"... he is here representing the Department of Public Relations, and his involvement does not pertain to your specific case. Please ignore him unless he directly interacts with you, if you do not comply there may be further charges put to your record."

The slender corporal picks at some papers, looking them over in the steam.
>"We have various questions you are required to answer to determine a final outcome of your sentence. A refusal to answer a question will result in marking a 'No Comment'. I suggest you refrain from doing so, lack of information is always detrimental to your final outcome."

Wryly then begins to place various questionairs, an ink well, fountain pen an assortment of rubber stamps, an ink pad and a perforated metal orb in an orthogonal arrangement on the table. They push up and down on a mechnism on the orb and a sickly light pink smoke begins to woft from the inside of the device. It's impossible to avoid breathing it in. A moment later you feel much better, other than the bruising and possible fractures, the incense has brought back an energy that empowers you to think clearly, and possibly speak. Wryly inspects the stamps, adjusting the small dials, possibly the date, dips the fountain pen in the red ink and begins to read out the questions.

### Sentence
Termors are felt through the space as concrete dust trickles down the cylindrical walls. A distant explosion interupts the corporal. They check their watch and look concerned.
>"It seems we must cut this short, but I have enough information to make a final judgement on the sentence."

Wryly picks up one of the stamps, and with a double pump brings it down onto the ink pad and onto the papers. Like a red fire brand, you make out a two bold "I"s encased in a box, with caption "Incorrigible - Insolvent".
A second tremor, much larger, shakes the room. This time it causes Corporal Clench to react, he breaks his stare with Wryly and begins to trudge along the shaking catwalk.
Wryly notices this, stands up quickly.
>"You're sentence will commence immediately."

Swiftly taking the papers with them, ingoring everything else, the corporal dashes away overtaking the PR thug. The corporal calls over their shoulder
>"Oh, Speak to the machine and it will clarify any queries or requests! AND there is no need to hold your breath!"

Immediately after the door shuts, the droning noise in the space gets louder, and you feel yourself being lowered, the concrete chair and table dropping slowly on cables. The air rapidly cools, as a blast of cold air rushes from below you, the stationary on the table shoot away in an instant, and then a cold water seeps over the platform onto your feet.
Another tremor, another explosion. Looking up you can see the volcanic clouds lit with bright purple light. 
You keep descending, the water finally reaches your mouth, and you take a deep breath.
Eyes closed, the droning noise dies away as you are completely submerged. For a moment you feel yourself floating away from the chair as it keeps decending, the chains pulling your wrists down still. And then the floating stops, abruptly, and you fall a short distance back onto the block, knocking the wind out of you...
Water doesn't rush into your mouth and lungs. Instead the air you breath back is crisp and clean. You open your eyes to find youself still sitting at a concrete table, the manacles and chains have disolved, the remains look like meat jelly, falling away from your writsts onto the table. A street lamp illuminates the immediate space around you, leaving everywhere else pitch black. Running in and out of the darkness are shiny rail tracks, similar to the ones the streetcars use in Thule. Sat adjacent to you at their own blocks are <3> other people, half naked, branded with barcodes and bruised all over, just like you. They all appear to be going through the same confusing existential ordeal you are.
