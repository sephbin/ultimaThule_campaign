# Pit Wall
[[Thule]] is a city built in a mega-sized floating disk. The disk is not perfectly flat, Thule happens to have a "river", and it contains a wide metalic collar that runs around the circumference. This collar defines the pit wall which terminates at a natural topography of soil and sometimes stone.
The landscape is not flat, and some areas where the city proper meets the collar have dikes and various other landforms to allow travel to the edge. At other points the elevation difference is significant, and makeshift elevators and vertical transport devices have been installed.

The pit wall appears to be metalic, machined with blemishes. It has resisted all [[magescience]] tests to detect what it is made from. Most of the properties noted are a lack of property:
- no magnetic field
- no magical aura
- no audible frequency
- no heat transfer

Other than a lack of these physical properties, it does:
- reflect energy waves and physical bodies
	- light
	- sound
	- heat
	- [[mana]] and [[mana state energy]]
- have a friction coefficient

It is effectively impervious to any damage, and therefore has been used innovatively as a support for structures, and a means to create measurement metrics. Relative to the size of a regular Thulese person or structure, the Pit Wall is flat, and therefore can be used to test rulers and is regularly used as a reference point in Thulese property law and city planning. Various caloquial terms have arisen referencing the wall, such as:
"\[They/It\] are/is as straight as the Pit Wall" is a term used to reference a person or system that appears at first to be honest, true and trustworthy but once you see the bigger picture they are corrupt liars and or tainted systems.
