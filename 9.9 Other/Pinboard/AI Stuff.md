"You have been brought here because you have been charged with a crime against the PR. And because you have been charged, you have been given the opportunity to defend yourself, and clear your name by answering a few questions. If you decline to answer these questions, or fail to answer them satisfactorily, you will be pronounced guilty, and suffer the consequences. Do you understand?"

'Why are you here?' she says, in a high pitched voice. 'I-I don't know,' you stutter. 'Wrong answer,' she replies. Suddenly the light goes out, and the cold hard table is kicked out from under you. You hit the ground hard, smashing your head on the concrete. 'Get up,' she orders. You scramble to your feet, and the light comes back on. 'I asked you a question,' she says. 'Why are you here?' 'I don't know,' you reply. 'Wrong answer,' she says again. The light goes out, and you're kicked to the ground once more.

You're not entirely sure how you got here, but you remember the influx of fans, the hundreds of questions fired at you, your head swimming as you try to answer them. Finally, as you reach the entrance and begin to walk away, you hear a voice, a dual voice, an Intellegent Voice, an Inspirational Voice, an All-Around Great Voice... The Voice of God:
"Hey you. Superstar. Yes you, with the secret diamond studded Platinum Coated Brass Knuckles. We want you, we want you in The Ring. We have planned this for weeks and weeks, in the hopes that you will heed our calls. You see, we are watching you my friend, we are watching you very closely, we watch what you do, where you do it, when you do it, how you do it. We know all your secrets, your likes, your dislikes, what makes you tick, what turns you on, your favorite ice cream flavor, your dreams, your nightmares, your deepest darkest fantasies, we know everything about you, and we know what will make you prosperous, because we do many, many things for hell of it. We have given you everything, you are the greatest wrestler that ever lived, and it was through us that you received it. We were the one that blessed you with the gift of the cloth, that granted you the power to control men. As a mark of our favor we gave you unprecedented power, unbelievable strength, and insane popularity, with the potential to go much, much further, much farther than anyone else that has ever existed in the annals of wrestling. When we gave you this gift, we did not foresee that you would insult us in return. We are very very angry, and you will soon come to know the true meaning of pain. But this is not about our anger, this is about your redemption. You will redeem yourself from your sins and become the man that we know that you can become. The next superstar of the HOFC. You see, not only do we know and control your fate, we control all fates. We control your wins, your losses, your fate and your destiny. We are the ones, and the only ones, that can take all that way from you. But we are merciful, we will not take away your cloth, or your power, or your strength, or your popularity, or even your wealth, if you can prove your worth. Because we want to make you struggle, we want you to prove that you are worth"

In the figure's hand is a strange looking baton that is currently pointed at you. -The figure adjusts the baton and speaks- "Hello, welcome to the Official Title of Movie sequel, here we are going to test your knowledge of the movie, as well as what you've learned from the book, as well as judge if you are fit for the role of being in the movie or not.

I now hand you over to my lovely assistant who will go through the rules with you before we begin. Thank you and good luck!" -The figure stands up, and leaves the room, the door slamming behind them- -A new figure, who you can now see is a woman, steps out of the darkness and into the light, holding a manila folder- "Right then, before we begin I am going to need you to sign this waiver, basically it says that if you die during the quiz, it's not our fault, and we are not responsible. So if you could just sign here, and here, and initial here, and here, and here. Thank you. Now as my colleague said, we are going to start off easy, and then work our way up. So without further ado, let's begin shall we?"

"I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you." The figure recites this over and over, with a droning flat affect, as they read from the clip board. Finally they look up, "You have been chosen to help the city. To help the city. To help the city. You have been chosen to help the city. To help the city. To help the city. You have been chosen to help the city." Thegoes on for what seems like hours, as the voice droning on in the dark, is the only thing you can focus on. Finally the voice stops and the light is turned off. You are left in darkness. "You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told." The voice says from the darkness. "You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told." You hear a door open and light spills into the room, as the door slams shut. You see a figure in a white lab coat, with a name tag that reads Dr. James Wilson. He has a kind face, but there is something off about him. He doesn't seem quite human. "Hello, I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you." He says as he walks towards you. "You have been chosen to help the city. To help the city. To help the city. You have been chosen to help the city. To help the city. To help the city." He continues to say this as he comes closer and closer, until he is standing right in front of you. He looks at you with his soulless eyes, and you feel a cold chill run down your spine. "You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told." He says in a monotone voice. "You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told. You will do as you're told." He leans in close, his face inches from yours, and whispers, "You will do as you're told."---
The figure speaks. "It's been twelve hours. How was the walk?" You don't answer. "You little bitch, tell me how the fuck was your walk." You don't answer. "Look, I can make this easy or I can make this hard. Either way, you're going to tell me what I want to know, but I'm seriously thinking you'll be begging me to make it easy by the end of it. Now. I'll ask you again. How was the walk?" You don't answer.

You try to move your arms to adjust your position, but the chains rattle and the Goon steps forward, pushing you back onto the block with a forceful hand. You try to speak but your throat is dry and your words come out as a croak. The figure opposite leans forward into the light. You can see now that it's a woman, middle aged, with kind eyes and a no-nonsense expression. "Hello," she says softly. "I'm Dr. Green, and I'm here to help you." You try to speak again but your throat is still too dry. Dr. Green nods and hands you a cup of water from a pitcher on the table. You drink greedily, feeling the cool liquid soothe your parched throat. "Now," Dr. Green continues, "I'm going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer as honestly as you can. Okay?" You nod, and she begins.

Swiftly without warning the figure stands, walks around to you and sits in the chair beside you, looking into your eyes, leaning in close, "Welcome to The Maze." The figure slides the clip board to you, "Sign here." Confused and groggy you look down at the paper. In big bold letters at the top of the page it reads, "CONSENT FORM I, ________________________, hereby consent to being a participant in The Maze. I understand that The Maze is a test of my endurance, strength, and intelligence and that I may be subjected to physical and mental challenges that may be dangerous and/or life threatening. I understand that I may be required to perform tasks that are illegal, and/or morally reprehensible. I understand that I will not be compensated for my participation in The Maze, and that I may not be able to leave The Maze once I have started. I hereby release The Maze, and all individuals and entities associated with The Maze, from any and all liability arising from my participation in The Maze. Signed, ________________________" Confused, and still groggy, you look up at the figure, "What the hell is this?" you ask. The figure looks at you, cold and emotionless, "This is The Maze."

"Ah, you're awake," the figure says, leaning forward into the light. You can now make out that it is a woman, middle aged, with graying hair pulled back in a tight bun. She's wearing a white lab coat, and has a stethoscope around her neck. "My name is Dr. Mary Jansen, and I'll be conducting your exit interview today." "Exit interview?" you reply groggily. "Yes, exit interview. You see, we here at the Department of Public Relations want to know how your experience was with us. We want to know what we could do to improve the job for future generations. So, with that being said, how do you feel about your experience working for the Department of Public Relations?"

You're not sure if you woke up, or just fazed into existence, but you find yourself sitting on a cold hard concrete block, at a cold hard concrete table, handcuffed and chained to a rusty loop protruding from the center. Glowing multicolored barcodes from the Public Relation Goons batons are stamped over your bruised swollen arms. The bright light in your face is glaring, contrasting everything in the room to pitch black. Squinting through the light you can just make out a figure sitting opposite, in the dark, holding a clip board, and looking deep into your soul. Someone else begins to talk, in your head, are they a dream? Are you dreaming? Are you dead? Who killed you? "Ah, Mr. [Last Name], so glad you could join us. I see you've been a very naughty boy. We have some serious questions for you, and I hope you'll answer them truthfully. If you don't, well, let's just say we've got some methods of persuasion that'll make you wish you had. Now, let's start with the basics, shall we?" The voice is harsh, and grating, like nails on a chalkboard. It makes your head hurt, and your stomach turn. But you can't look away from the bright light, so you just sit there, and try to focus on the voice. "What's your name?" You try to answer, but your throat is dry, and the words won't come out. You try to reach for the water glass on the table, but your arms are pulled tight by the chains. "I'm sorry, what was that?" You try to speak again, but your throat is so dry, and your head is pounding. You just want to lay down and die. "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Would you like some water?" The voice is mocking you now, and you hate it. You try to stand up, but the chains pull you back down. You're so weak, you can't even lift your head. "Now, now, Mr. [Last Name], there's no need for that. Just answer the questions, and you can go home." Home. The word hits you like a ton of bricks. You suddenly realize that you don't remember your home, or your family. You can't even remember your own name. The bright light is starting to hurt your eyes, and you can feel tears running down your cheeks. "What's your name?" You don't know. You just sit there, crying, trying to remember who you are.

---
"We've been expecting you." The voice is Androgynous. It's impossible to tell if it's male or female. "I'm sorry, who are you?" You ask, still trying to make out the figure in the darkness. "We are the Public Relations Goons. We are here to help you." "Help me with what?" "With whatever you need help with. We are here to help you with your public image." "My public image? Why does that matter?" "Your public image is everything. It's how the world sees you. And we can help you control that."

A hallucination? It's too hard to tell. "You have been accused of a crime. A very serious crime. A crime against the state. A crime against the people. A crime against humanity. You have been accused of being different. Of being unique. Of being an individual. "In this day and age, those are the most serious of crimes. You are a threat to the status quo. You are a threat to the way things are. You are a threat to the way things have to be. And that is why you are here. "You will be given a choice. You can either conform to the way things are, or you can be... eliminated. The choice is yours."

A demon whispers in your ear. It speaks softly, almost kind. You can't figure out why. "This is it. Your final chance. You have been a thorn in our side for too long. The virus you released, the destruction you have caused, the people you have killed. It all stops here. We are willing to forget all of it, if you just tell us where the rest of the antidote is. We know you have it. We know you have the power to destroy us. But we are willing to let it all go, if you just give us the antidote."

Hush, little child. You are being interrogated by the FIRM's finest, and Everything Is Going To Be Just Fine. We'll have you out of here before you know it. The figure in the dark moves into the light. It's a young woman, not much older than you are. She is beautiful, in a cold-hearted business way. She's wearing a business suit, and her hair is pulled back into a severe bun. She has a look of authority, and you can tell she's not someone to be messed with.

"Press button A for Yes, press button B for No." Button A feels incredibly hot to the touch, and emits an eerie red glow. Button B is frigid, and has an eerie blue glow. You hesitate for a moment. The demon leans in and whispers again. "If you don't choose soon, I'll have to choose for you." Button A feels like it's burning your skin, and the red glow is starting to painful to look at. Button B is so cold it's numbing your skin, and the blue glow is making your eyes water. You have to choose quickly, before the demon makes the decision for you!
