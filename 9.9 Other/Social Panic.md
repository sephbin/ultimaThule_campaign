Social panic is the public anxiety or alarm in response to a perceived threat to the social standards of society.
The road to social panic has several stops, the first is concern.
This concern, limited at first, spreads from person to person, amplified by cultural forces, such as mass media and populist theory, until rational concern becomes irrational fear.
People come to believe something terrible is happening to them, something they cannot control. Whether or not the threat is real, the response certainly is and it is often excessive.
